Did you know that more than half of the waste in landfills comes from households, and around 25% of it is placed in the wrong bin? This means we are sending reusable items to waste sites, further contributing to global warming.

That's why I created EcoCycle: a web app that uses a deep-learning image classification model to identify items in your home and provide creative ideas for upcycling them, helping reduce household waste.
